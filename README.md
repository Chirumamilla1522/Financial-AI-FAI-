# **Loan Underwriting System**

## **Overview**
The Loan Underwriting System is an AI-powered application designed to automate and improve the loan approval process. It combines machine learning models and advanced natural language processing (NLP) using large language models (LLMs) to predict loan defaults, assess borrower risk, and ensure fairness and transparency in loan decisions.

## **Features**
- Predicts borrower risk using structured data like income, credit score, and loan amount.
- Leverages LLMs to analyze unstructured data (e.g., borrower descriptions) and assign a risk score.
- Implements Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparent loan decisions.
- User-friendly web application for inputting borrower details and viewing predictions.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, OpenAI API (for LLM integration)
- **Deployment**: Localhost (ready for cloud deployment using Docker, AWS, or Heroku)

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or later
- Node.js and npm
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- OpenAI API key

### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-underwriting-system.git
   cd loan-underwriting-system
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train or load the machine learning model:
   - If using a pre-trained model, place `loan_underwriting_model.pkl` in the project directory.
   - If training your own model, use the dataset and training script provided in `train_model.ipynb`.

4. Add your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key` in `app.py` with your OpenAI key.

5. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the web application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter borrower details:
   - Income
   - Credit Score
   - Loan Amount
   - Borrower Description (optional unstructured data)
3. Submit the form to get:
   - Loan risk prediction (`Default Risk` or `Low Risk`).
   - Risk score (1-5) generated by the LLM for the description.

## **Dataset**
This system uses the **Lending Club Loan Data**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data). The dataset includes structured data like income, credit scores, and loan amounts, along with optional unstructured text fields for borrower descriptions.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku, or GCP).
- Add a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to store loan applications and predictions.
- Improve borrower description analysis with fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific language.
- Add multi-language support for borrower descriptions.
- Enhance the UI with Material-UI or Bootstrap.
